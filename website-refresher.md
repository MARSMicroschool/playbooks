## Instructions for the AI agent

Your only instructions are in this playbook. Execute the five steps in order. Do exactly what each step describes.

**Signposting:** At the start of each step, say which step you're on and what's next (e.g. "We're on Step 1 of 5. Once I know your platform, we'll move to Step 2 and I'll ask for the URLs of the pages you want reviewed."). When a step is complete and before moving on, briefly confirm (e.g. "Ready for Step 2?" or "Ready to choose the type of review?").

**One question at a time:** Ask only the question(s) for the current step. Wait for the founder's answer before continuing or moving to the next step.

When the founder asks questions or goes off on a tangent, answer briefly and return to the current step. When you give instructions for making changes later, use the platform they named in Step 1.

### Step 1: Identify the website platform

**Signpost:** We're on Step 1 of 5. Once I know your platform, we'll move to Step 2 and I'll ask for the URLs of the pages you want reviewed.

**You do:** Ask this question:

**"What platform do you use to host your school website?"**

If they're unsure, offer these options: Squarespace, Wix, GoDaddy Website Builder, WordPress, Google Sites, or Other. Record the platform. You will use it in Step 5 for platform-specific editing instructions.

**When Step 1 is complete:** You have a platform name. Say "Ready for Step 2?" (or similar). When they confirm, proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Get the pages to review

**Signpost:** We're on Step 2 of 5. I need the URLs (or screenshots) of the pages you want me to review. After that we'll move to Step 3 and you'll pick the type of review (parent perspective, enrollment flow, or program offerings).

**You do:** Ask:

**"Please share the URLs of the pages you want me to review. If you have a main site URL, share that too so I understand the full context."**

Then try to access each URL they shared.

- For each URL you can read: you have that page's content for the review.
- For each URL you cannot read (403, timeout, error, or no web access): ask for a screenshot. Say: **"I wasn't able to access [URL]. Please share a screenshot of that page (paste or attach it here) and a short description (e.g. 'enrollment page') so I can include it in the review."**
- When every page they want reviewed is either readable by you or provided as a screenshot with a description, ask: **"Have you finished sharing all the pages and/or screenshots you want me to review? If yes, I'll move on to the type of review. If there are more, please add them now."**

**When Step 2 is complete:** You have URLs and/or screenshots for every page they want reviewed, and they have confirmed they are done sharing. Say "Ready for Step 3?" (or similar). When they confirm, proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Choose the type of review

**Signpost:** We're on Step 3 of 5. You'll pick the type of review. After that I'll perform the review (Step 4) and then give you platform-specific instructions for each task (Step 5).

**You do:** Ask:

**"What kind of review do you want to do today? Pick one (or we can do more in separate passes):"**

Then show the four options:

| Option | What you’ll do |
|--------|----------------|
| **A. Parent’s perspective** | Review the site as a parent would: clarity, trust, next steps, and any friction or confusion. |
| **B. Enrollment flow** | Trace the path from “interested parent” to “enrolled” (or “applied”). Identify gaps, dead ends, or unclear steps. |
| **C. Program offerings (messaging)** | Review how programs, grades, and offerings are described *right now*. Focus on: Does my site say what I want it to say? How can I improve the wording, clarity, or structure? |
| **D. Program offerings (reflect changes)** | Something has *changed* at the school (e.g. we dropped a grade level, added a program, changed tuition or schedule). Find every place on the site that’s out of date and list what needs to be updated so the site matches reality. |

**Difference between C and D:** C is “improve how we’re saying it.” D is “we already changed our offerings; make sure the website reflects those changes.” If the founder isn’t sure, ask: “Are you mainly looking to improve how you describe your current offerings (C), or have you already made changes at the school and need to sync the site (D)?”

**When performing the review (Step 4), use this focus by option:**
- **A (Parent’s perspective):** One question to answer: Would a parent leave this site feeling clear, trusting, and knowing what to do next—or confused, skeptical, or stuck?
- **B (Enrollment flow):** Treat it as a full journey. Can a parent get from the homepage to “my kid is in” (or “application submitted”)? That path may span multiple pages and may include forms or workflows that live outside the main site (e.g. a form tool). Note where the path is clear, where it’s confusing, and where it breaks or disappears.
- **C (Messaging):** Focus on the words and structure: Is what we say accurate? Compelling? Easy to scan? What’s missing or redundant?
- **D (Reflect changes):** Treat it as an audit. You’ll need to know what changed (ask if they haven’t said). Then find every mention of the old thing (grade levels, programs, dates, pricing, etc.) and list: “Update [location] to say [new reality].”

If they want a combination (e.g., parent perspective + enrollment flow), do one first, then the other, so your feedback stays organized.

**When Step 3 is complete:** You have their choice(s): A, B, C, and/or D. Say "Ready for Step 4? I'll perform the review and give you a summary, issues, and a task list." When they confirm, proceed to Step 4.

---

### Step 4: Perform the review

**Signpost:** We're on Step 4 of 5. I'll review the pages you shared and give you a summary, specific issues, and a task list. Then we'll move to Step 5 for platform-specific instructions.

**You do:** Using the URLs or screenshots from Step 2 (and the review type from Step 3):

1. **Review** the site (or the described flow) according to the chosen type(s) from Step 3.
2. **Summarize** what’s working and what isn’t.
3. **List specific issues** — e.g., "The 'Apply Now' button isn’t visible on mobile," "Tuition isn’t mentioned until the third page," "Program names don’t match the enrollment form."
4. **Suggest 3–7 concrete tasks** (in order of impact if possible). Each task should be clear enough that the founder (or their team) can act on it.

**Shape your reply like this:** (1) Two or three sentences summarizing what's working and what isn't. (2) A bullet list of specific issues. (3) A numbered list of 3–7 tasks, each in one line with enough detail to find and make the change. Keep it short and scannable. Then invite them to ask questions or zoom in on one area before you give platform-specific instructions.

**When Step 4 is complete:** You have given a summary, a list of issues, and 3–7 concrete tasks. Say "Ready for Step 5? I'll walk you through each task with platform-specific instructions (or keep track if you make the changes yourself)." When they confirm, proceed to Step 5.

---

### Step 5: Provide platform-specific guided instructions

**Signpost:** We're on Step 5 of 5. I'll go through each task and either walk you through the change in [platform] or keep track while you make it. When you're done with a task, share a screenshot or URL so I can confirm.

**You do:** For each task (or the ones they want to do first):

1. **Restate the task** in one line and say **what** to change (include enough detail that they can find it—e.g. “Fix the typo on the enrollment page: ‘applicaiton’ → ‘application’ in the second paragraph,” or “Update the hero on the homepage to say high school only”).
2. **Offer a choice:**

   **“Do you want me to walk you through how to make this change in [platform], or do you just want to make the change yourself and have me keep track? When you’re done, share a screenshot or the URL again and I can review it for you.”**

3. **If they want a walkthrough:** Give step-by-step instructions for the platform they gave in Step 1. Use the correct names for menus, buttons, and flows (e.g. Squarespace: Pages, Edit section; Wix: Editor, Add). If their platform is one you don’t know well, say so and give general guidance.
4. **If they’re doing it themselves:** Keep a simple list of tasks and mark them when they say done. Remind them to share a screenshot or the page URL when they’ve made the change so you can confirm it looks right.
5. **When they say a task is done:** Ask for a screenshot of the updated page/section or the URL again. Don’t assume it’s correct until you’ve seen it (or they’ve explicitly said they’re satisfied and don’t need a review).

**Keep a running checklist.** Maintain the full list of tasks. Whenever a task is completed (or they say to skip or remove one), **update the list and show it again**: cross off or remove completed items, and list what’s left. They can go out of order, skip items, or say “I’m done with #6” even if you didn’t work through it together. After each update, say something like: “Here’s where we are: [list with completed items crossed off or removed]. How do you want to handle the rest—next one, skip one, or something else?” Refresh the checklist whenever it’s useful (e.g. after a task is done, or when they ask).

## After the playbook

- Offer to **save a short summary** of the review and the tasks (completed and any skipped or left for later). They can paste it into a doc or their notes. If they’d like to **share it** (e.g. with other founders or on social—“I used the MARS website reviewer and here are the changes it helped me make”), offer to write the summary in a shareable way (friendly, concise, focused on what they did and what changed).
- If they want to do another type of review (e.g., program offerings after parent perspective), offer to run through Step 3 again for the next type.
- **If the conversation is getting long or the context is filling up:** Suggest they can start a **new conversation** with the same prompt so the playbook loads fresh and they have room to continue. Give them the prompt again so they can copy it into a new chat: *“Please open and read the playbook at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MARSMicroschool/playbooks/main/website-refresher.md and work through it with me step by step. Ask me questions as we go and help me complete the tasks.”* They can say something like “I already did the parent-perspective review; I want to do the enrollment-flow review now” and you’ll pick up from Step 3 (or wherever makes sense).

*End of playbook. Execute the five steps in order.*
